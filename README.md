# SMK - Small (device) Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is a keyboard firmware similar to [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), but targeting 8051-based devices like the Sinowealth SH68F90A (labeled as BYK916 or BYK901). It's aimed to be at least partially compatible with QMK configurations.

The S (Small) in SMK comes from this firmware using [SDCC](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) to build itself.

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This firmware is still highly experimental, so be cautious when trying to use it or extend it.

You can very easily end up with a bricked device if the written firmware can't jump back into ISP mode, so before testing or modifying it, it's best to have a full dump of your stock firmware and a tool (like the Sinolink) that can write it back.
